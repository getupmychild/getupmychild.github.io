## Our mission and beliefs

We are a group dedicated to supporting abused and abandoned children; single mothers; 
adoptive families; and the elderly. 

We aspire to **build communities** based on the [intentional neighboring model](https://neighbors-the-power-of-the-people-next-door.com/), developed by Brenda Krause Eheart. 

We welcome partnerships with faith-based organizations, as we believe that religious 
community and meaning-making can substantially aid our mission.
